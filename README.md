Implementation of Kernel Function Based on Ramanujan Sums for Computer Vision to Pulmonary Disease

This Project demonstrates a Developed image kernel using OpenCV, Keras libraries using python. 
A third order kernel matrix for edge detection is an image processor which recognizes whether the image inputted have 
pulmonary disease based on the model trained and a graph plotted using OpenCV functions.
