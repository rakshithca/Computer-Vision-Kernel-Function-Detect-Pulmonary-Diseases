Implementation of Kernel Function Based on Ramanujan Sums for Computer Vision to detect Pulmonary Disease

This Project demonstrates a developed Image Kernel using OpenCV, Keras libraries using python. 
A third order kernel matrix for edge detection is an image processor which recognizes whether the image inputted have 
pulmonary disease based on the model trained and a graph plotted using OpenCV functions.

It takes images form a specific directory "data/test/" and runs it with the ramanujam sums function to determine whether the lungs image are the one which are infected by TB or not. There is a file named trainingdata, which trains the data and then the images are read from the directory which will be a test data for this program The edges are marked and thus it determines whether a healthy lung or a ruptured lungs image is being read. This helps in early detection of the pulmonary diseases.
